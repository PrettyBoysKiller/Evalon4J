# Evalon4J - The Ultimate Java API Documentation Generator

## Introduction

Evalon4J is a framework developed for Mac App [RabiAPI](https://github.com/RabiAPI/RabiAPI-Support), you can directly
use it as a command tool for generating java api documentation.

I have used SpringFox before, it's needs a lot of configurations and I think markdown is enough for me, so I developed this tool.

If you like it **!!!PLEASE STAR THIS PROJECT!!!**

## How To Use

Evalon4J is a command line tool and very easy to use.

1. Download the zip file and extract it.
2. Get into the `bin` directory from terminal.
3. Execute `./evalon4j -p {{Your Java Project Path}} -o markdown`
4. Done

- `-o` specify the output formatï¼Œnow support: `markdown`, `swagger`, `openapi`
- `-c` specify a `evalon4j.json` configuration file, or just put it under your project root

## Configuration

You can also put a `evalon4j.json` file under your project root, or using `-c` to specify one.
